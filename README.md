Summary:

F Rahman has set up a continuous data set on Kaggle containing details of all earthquakes that have happened in the last 30 days from USGS (U.S Geological Survey) real-time notifications, feeds and web services about earthquakes.
Dataset downloaded for analysis covers 17 Dec 24 – 16 Jan 25

Conducted a broad picture analysis, looking at date, place (longitude, latitude), event type, magnitude and depth data that is most accessible to non-expert. 
Investigated if we see differences in magnitude, depth and event types when we separate the Americas from the rest of the world.
Created 2 datasets separating based on longitude data: North and South America (Americas), Rest of the world (non-Americas)
